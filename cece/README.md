**📔 World 8 - The Story created by our group:**

"Your family has for generations pressed "The Button" to keep the sun shining, which only needs to be done every hundred year. You lost interest in it when you hit your teens and after all the partying and traveling you had completely forgot about your responsibility and the process how to press this well hidden (from the world) button. You realize that it's already the year 3000 and it's YOUR duty to save the world! You need to find all the heirloom from your family to remember how to get to the button and find keys desiphering the cryptig riddles left behind by your ancestors."

**👩‍💻 My process:**

I decided after a lecture that I wanted to exlore Bitsy. I love retro games and it felt superfun to create my own pixle game. I started with creating just a small cat and dog game with the tools that was provided by the standard bitsy editor, just to learn what I could do with the tool, such as conditional dialogue, variables handeling, exits and items.
After that, I played other bitsy games just to get inspirations and try to figure out how they could have created their different scenarios. I also watched some tutorials and joined the Bitsy Discor server to read a bit tips & tricks and things that others have had problems with.
I used the Bitsy Editor and Borksy to add community created hacks to my game, then in the end I worked alot directly in VS code and making it look how I wanted it. 

I enjoyed the process! It was a fun little game to play, and it was a nice tool to use at level 1, since it is a very limited tool in one way, but that what makes one get extra creative! :)

I used the Pixilart to plan the look of my tiles and sprites and items before entering coding it into my level. I also user Miro board for planning of dialogue and counting my pixilart.
